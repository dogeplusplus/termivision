# termivision

### Summary
`termivision` converts pictures/videos into colored ANSI block characters in the terminal.
This lets you watch videos right from the terminal without a GUI (WIP).
Right now you can print the whole video to the terminal and scroll through it like a flipbook.

#### TODO
- [x] Figure out a way of converting images to terminal output
- [x] Print video/gif to the terminal
- [ ] Add handlers for dealing with either images or videos
- [ ] Figure out how to control the flush rate
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Add instructions for installing OpenCV
